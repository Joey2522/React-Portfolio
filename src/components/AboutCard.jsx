            Hello, my name is Joseph Porter but everyone calls me Joey. 
            I currently live in the greater Austin metro area with my wife and 3 kids. 
            I began my coding journey almost 6 months ago. I
            enrolled in an online coding boot camp hosted by the University of Texas. 
            Having no previous coding experience made the boot camp on of the most challenging 
            experiences I have ever gone through. Despite the difficulty I know that completing 
            this boot camp will also be one of the most rewarding experiences as well. 
            I hope you enjoy walking through my portfolio and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
            </p>
