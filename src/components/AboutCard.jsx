            <p>
                Hello, my name is Joseph Porter but everyone calls me Joey. I currenlty live in 
                the greater Austin metro area with my wife and 3 children. I began my coding journey 
                almost 6 months ago. I joined an online coding bootcamp hosted by the University of Texas. Having
                no previous coding experience made my bootcamp one of the most challenging endeavers I have ever
                walked through. Although its to early to say for sure but I do hope that it is also the most rewarding
                challenge as well. 
            </p>
